************** S@M ****************

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Installation under Linux 
-------------------------------------------------------------

There is an installation program with the Package. It copies the files where they belong, updates the init.m file in the .Mathematica/Autoload/ directory in the home directory, so that you can load the package without having to give the whole path.  

To install the package, copy the tar file Spinors-X.n.tar.gz  to your disk, unpack it with

> gunzip Spinors-X.n.tar.gz
> tar -xf  Spinors-X.n.tar

Change directory to the Spinors-X.n directory

> cd  Spinors-X.n

Execute :

> ./InstallSpinors

and follow the instructions...

Note that you might have to change the permission of the installation script:

> chmod +x InstallSpinors

If you encounter installation problems, please read the INSTALLATION PROBLEMS section below

-----------------------------------------------------------------
S@M installation for Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There is no script which automatically installs S@M under Windows. If you want to use S@M under Windows you should follow the following steps:

- Download the file Spinors-X.n.tar.gz

- Unpack it in the directory where you want S@M to be installed

- In this directory you find a file called init.windows, modifiy the first line such that your installation path replaces

              the:\path\of\the\installation

- To load the package you have to type in Mathematica

Get[ToFileName[{"the:\path\of\the\installation"},"init.windows" ]]

<<Spinors`

If you don't want to type the first line each time, you can add the content of the init.windows file of S@M to the init.m file in the AutoLoad directory of your Mathematica installation. You will then only need to type 

<<Spinors`

to load the package.

------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION PROBLEMS WITH THE INSTALLATION SCRIPT
------------------------------------------------------------------

If the installation script ended with the error message 

"The Mathematica shell command math could not be found."

the installation could not be checked from the script. This happens when there is no shell version of mathematica insalled or if the command math is not accessible from the place where the script is run. The installation might have worked, so please try to load the package with

 <<Spinors`  

If you get the error message

Get::noopen: Cannot open Spinors`

this means that Mathematica is not finding the init.m file in the Autoload directory. Please check that this file is present in

Linux: $HOME/.Mathematica/Autoload
Mac: $HOME/Library/Mathematica/Autoload

if the init.m file is present but the package does not get loaded, this means that mathematica fails to look in this directory at startup. In this case please add the line

Get[ToFileName["/the/autoload/path","init.m"]]  

(where /the/autoload/path is to be replaced by the above path)

to the init.m file in the Kernel directory

Linux: $HOME/.Mathematica/Kernel
Mac: $HOME/Library/Mathematica/Kernel

This will force mathematica to look into the Autoload Directory. This change will only take effect when you restart the Mathematica Kernel. Try to load the package after restarting the kernel. If it doesn't work, please report the problem at maitreda@slac.stanford.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------
Uninstall S@M
------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the program

> ./UninstallSpinors

in the installation directory of S@M.

Bug reports, bug fixes, new versions
------------------------------------------------------------------

Great care has been taken in testing  the S@M package.  However, if there are problems left we would appreciate to get bug reports to maitreda@slac.stanford.edu. If you want to get informed upon bug fixes and new versions, please send us your Email address.
